# Russian translation for night night.

[nightnight.みんな](http://nightnight.xn--q9jyb4c/) (みんな is Japanese for "everyone") is a simple program that allows you to put your website to sleep, encouraging your users to go to head to bed, better supporting their health and well being.

Kudos to [Masamichi Souzou](http://mmsz.co/).
